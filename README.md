# M5 Paper JS Controller

This project allows you to control your M5 Paper from the JS code running on the server through Wi-Fi. You don't need to write low-level code anymore!

For the client (M5 Paper) side you need to compile and upload code through Arduino IDE with M5 Paper board support and M5EPD library installed.

For the server (JS) you need to run `bun run Server/index.ts`.
